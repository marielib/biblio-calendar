# biblio-calendar
BiblioEvents Calendar Helper (BiblioCommons)

GOALS
- Provide a variety of ways to organize, limit and display upcoming events

CURRENT FEATURES
- Limit by month or season
- Limit by branch, or show all
- Limit by some special event types (e.g. storytimes, non-storytimes, adult book clubs)
- Show or Hide descriptions
- Group events by audience
- Combine events with the same title; show descriptions if they are different

HOW TO TEST THIS SCRIPT
- Request an Events API key from BiblioCommons (if you are a customer)
- Add your Events API key to the "PRIVATE_API_KEY" variable in the script
- Change the "LIBRARY_ID" variable to your library's ID
- Open the script in a browser. I should display the loading GIF for 5-15 seconds, then display event data. If it never hides the GIF, check the developer console for errors.
